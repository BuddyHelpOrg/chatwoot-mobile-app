## About BuddyHelp

BuddyHelp is an emotional support platform, where we facilitate conversations between people who are in emotional distress with caring, patient, compassionate individuals who will listen, and hold space. Our volunteers are unpaid and have usually been through rough patches themselves, knowing just how much it helped to have someone to talk to.

When someone suffers from anxiety, job-related distress, domestic distress, breakups, fear of uncertainty, trauma, or simply not feeling their best, talking about it can help them mentally process their feelings and find their way back to the light. BuddyHelp aims to be that neutral partner, always there with an open ear.

## Features

- Connect with people seeking emotional support
- Follow up on conversations while on the go
- Reply easily with canned responses
- Receive realtime notifications about new support requests
- Communicate with other volunteers via private notes

To build the app locally, you need to set up configuration files:

1. Create a directory: `~/Documents/chatwoot-config-files/`
2. Place the required configuration files in this directory:
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS builds
   - `google-services.json` for Android builds
3. Run the build commands:
   - `pnpm build:ios:local` for iOS
   - `pnpm build:android:local` for Android

The build script will automatically copy these files to the correct locations before building.
