# BuddyHelp.org

## 1. Organization Context

BuddyHelp.org is an organization focused on connecting individuals with volunteer listeners for emotional support. We facilitate conversations between people who are in emotional distress with caring, patient, compassionate individuals who will listen, and hold space. They are unpaid volunteers and have usually been through a rough patch themselves, knowing just how much it helped to have someone to talk to.

In most cases, when one suffers from anxiety, job-related distress, domestic distress, breakups, fear of uncertainty, trauma, or simply not feeling one's best, the best thing one can do is to talk about it. This allows for you to mentally process what's in your head and find your way back to the light. In many cases, it is hard to find someone who will just listen, without judgement or trying to give unsolicited advice. BuddyHelp aims to be that neutral partner, always there for you, always with an open ear.
